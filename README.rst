Parboiled WKT
============
Parboiled WKT is a Java Library that uses the `Parboiled 1.x <https://github.com/sirthias/parboiled/wiki>`_ Library to parse WKT.

It does not use the awesome Java Topology Suite(JTS) because it parses Geometry types that JTS does not yet support.  It also can parse EWKT or WKT with a spatial reference system identifier. Finally, it can parse Geometry with XY, XYZ, XYM, or XYZM coordinates.
